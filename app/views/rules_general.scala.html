	<text>Generals are labelled with the Chinese character / About
	this sound jiàng ("general") on the black side and About this sound
	shuài ("marshal") on the red side. The general starts the game at the
	midpoint of the back edge, within the palace. The general may move and
	capture one point orthogonally. The two generals may not face each
	other in the same file with no intervening pieces. If that happens, the
	"flying general" move may be executed, in which one general may cross
	the board to capture the enemy general. In practice, this rule is only
	used to enforce checkmate. The general may not leave the palace except
	when executing the flying general move.[5] The Indian name king for
	this piece was changed to general because China's rulers objected to
	their royal titles being given to game pieces.</text>
