	<text>The general starts the game at the midpoint of the back edge, within
	the palace. The general may move and capture one point orthogonally.
	The two generals may not face each other in the same file with no
	intervening pieces. If that happens, the "flying general" move may
	be executed, in which one general may cross the board to capture the
	enemy general. In practice, this rule is only used to enforce
	checkmate. The general may not leave the palace except when executing
	the flying general move. The Indian name king for this piece was
	changed to general because China's rulers objected to their royal
	titles being given to game pieces.</text>
