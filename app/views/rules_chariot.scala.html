	<text>The chariot moves and captures any distance
	orthogonally, but may not jump over intervening pieces. The chariots
	begin the game on the points at the corners of the board. The chariot
	is often considered to be the strongest piece in the game due to its
	freedom of movement and lack of restrictions. The chariot is sometimes
	known as the rook by English-speaking players, since it is like the
	rook in Western chess. Chinese players (and others) often call this
	piece a car, since that is one modern meaning of the character.</text>
