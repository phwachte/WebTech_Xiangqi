		<text>Each side has five soldiers, labelled About this sound
		zú ("pawn" or "private") for Black and About this sound bīng
		("soldier") for Red. Soldiers begin the game located on every other
		point one row back from the edge of the river. They move and capture
		by advancing one point. Once they have crossed the river, they may
		also move and capture one point horizontally. Soldiers cannot move
		backward, and therefore cannot retreat; after advancing to the last
		rank of the board, however, a soldier may still move sideways at the
		enemy's edge. The soldier is sometimes called the "pawn" by
		English-speaking players, due to the pieces' similarities.</text>
