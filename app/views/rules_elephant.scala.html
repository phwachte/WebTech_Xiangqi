		<text>Elephants are labeled 象 xiàng ("elephant") for Black and
		相 xiàng ("minister") for Red. They are located next to the advisors.
		These pieces move and capture exactly two points diagonally and may
		not jump over intervening pieces; the move is described as being like
		the character 田 Tián ("field"). If an elephant cannot move due to a
		diagonally adjacent piece, it is known as "blocking the elephant's
		eye" (塞象眼).[dubious – discuss] Elephants may not cross the river, and
		serve as defensive pieces. Because an elephant's movement is
		restricted to just seven board positions, it can be easily trapped or
		threatened. The two elephants are often used to defend each other. The
		Chinese characters for "minister" and "elephant" are homophones in
		Mandarin (About this sound Listen) and both have alternative meanings
		as "appearance" or "image". However, both are referred to as elephants
		in the game.</text>
