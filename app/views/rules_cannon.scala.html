		<text>Cannons are labelled 砲 About this sound pào ("catapult")
		for Black and 炮 pào ("cannon") for Red. The names are homophones,
		though sometimes 炮 is used for both Red and Black. The 石 shí radical
		of 砲 means "stone", and the 火 huǒ radical of 炮 means "fire". Both
		colors' pieces are normally referred to as cannons in English. The
		black piece is sometimes labelled 包. Each player has two cannons,
		which start on the row behind the soldiers, two points in front of the
		horses. Cannons move like chariots, any distance orthogonally without
		jumping, but can only capture by jumping a single piece, friend or
		foe, along the path of attack. The piece over which the cannon jumps
		is called the 炮臺 (trad.) / 炮台 (simp.) pào tái ("cannon platform") or
		"screen". Any number of unoccupied spaces, including none, may exist
		between the cannon, screen, and the piece to be captured. Cannons can
		be exchanged for horses immediately from their starting positions.</text>
